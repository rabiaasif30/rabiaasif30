# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Corruptum Chaos

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

As a supervillian shreds its destruction upon a city, civillians fall victim. My Ren'py visual novel will be about two friends, to which one becomes "chaotouched." The other friend then has to find ways to extarct their friend back to normal from "Corruptum Chaos." 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My softawre will create a visual novel. The story will be executed sort of like a comic. My project may also include minigame(s) or some type of interavtivity the user can experience. My project will be executed using Python code. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will accomplish pages that the story can be told through. I will accomplish some sort of story. On the other hand something that may potentially not be accomplished is minigame(s) or interavtivity for user. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Better outcome would be the story pages and interactivity features. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome would be story completely delivered, interavtive options (I want to include an interactive map or like options the user can pick between), and at least one minigame. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For my next steps, I will watch YouTube videos on how to use Ren'py to create a good novel. I will need to research, how set scenes, charcter settings, how to create a map, how to pick between options, etc.
