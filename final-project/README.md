Final Project: 
- Project URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/memenator/

- I think the most difficult part of this project was making all the files work with each other. I enjoyed learning about languages I have never used before. I think this project was much more informational then my inital idea for my final project. Using the Flask module to create a web-page definitely was the way to go and I leanrned a lot of cool things along the way!
