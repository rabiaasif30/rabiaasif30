Final Project:

- I think the most difficult part of this project was making all the files work with each other. For instance, I made my CSS file and then reloaded the web-page and nothing was applied because I hade to link it to my HTML file. Another example is putting certain files in folders. I had to put the HTML file in a folder called templates and CSS and JS files in a folder called statics. So, making the files compatible with one another was a struggle. I found YouTube videos really helpful in providing me detailed steps. I enjoyed learning about languages I have never used before. I think this project was much more informational then my inital idea for my final project. Using the Flask module to create a web-page definitely was the way to go and I learned a lot of cool things along the way!
